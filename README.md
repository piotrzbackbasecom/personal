# personal
All of my public work related texts, snippets, scripts, etc. that can be shared worldwide.

# Currently:

* github-clone-organisations.sh - this is a simple script using Github CLI 'gh'
that should detect or install (or use docker image) with gh client on your workstation and clone all repositories of all organisations user belongs to (or only those listed in commandline) - this should make local development easier, also opens a path for locally (workstation) performed automation where necessary
